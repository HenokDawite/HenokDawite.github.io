I am pursuing a BA in Computer Science from Pomona College. I am learning to apply computational thinking and programming skills to solve complex problems and have a passion for technology and innovation. I am fluent in Amharic and English, have limited proficiency in Spanish, and enjoy learning new languages and cultures. I am a driven, adaptable, and collaborative individual who values teamwork, creativity, and excellence.
