## Project Overview

-   I used public traffic stop data to explore disparities in policing.\
-   Focused on two things:
    1.  How often people of different races are searched.\
    2.  What typically happens after someone is stopped.\
-   This was done using SQL and basic visual analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Data

-   From the Stanford Open Policing Project (50M+ stops).\
-   I looked at three NC cities (Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro) and Oakland, CA.\
-   Removed incomplete data to keep things clean and accurate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What I Looked At

-   How search rates compare by race across three NC cities.\
-   What the overall outcomes are after stops in Oakland.\
-   Focus was on identifying patterns — not proving intent or causation.

## Search Rate Results

-   In all three NC cities, Black drivers were searched more often than White drivers.\
-   Charlotte: 6.75% (Black) vs 2.25% (White).\
-   This pattern was consistent across Raleigh and Greensboro too.

## Stop Outcome Results

-   In Oakland:
    -   52% of stops led to citations\
    -   31% to warnings\
    -   17% to arrests\
-   Most stops don’t end in arrest, but 1 in 6 still do — which stands out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What the Patterns Suggest

-   The search data shows consistent gaps between racial groups.\
-   The outcome data shows how often enforcement escalates to arrest.\
-   Together, they highlight areas worth more attention and review.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How I Did It

-   I used SQL to group and filter the data.\
-   Focused on cities with full reporting to keep comparisons fair.\
-   The approach was simple, clean, and easy to trace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A Few Notes

-   I didn’t analyze outcomes by race — just overall rates.\
-   Not every city had usable data, so I narrowed the scope.\
-   This project shows patterns — not causes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Takeaway

-   The data shows real disparities in search rates across race.\
-   Simple analysis can bring out meaningful insights.\
-   Public data like this is a powerful tool for accountability.
