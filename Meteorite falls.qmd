## Introduction

This analysis explores meteorite data from The Meteoritical Society, examining the difference between meteorites that were observed falling to Earth and later recovered ("falls") versus those that were discovered without anyone witnessing the fall ("finds"). Meteorites provide valuable insights into the composition of objects in our solar system and can help scientists understand the formation and evolution of planetary bodies.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(ggplot2))
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))

# Load dataset
meteorites <- read.csv("meteorites.csv")

# Data preparation
meteorites_clean <- meteorites |>
  filter(!is.na(fall)) |>
  group_by(fall) |>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')

# Plot
ggplot(meteorites_clean, aes(x = fall, y = count, fill = fall)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Meteorite Falls vs. Finds",
       x = "Event Type (Fall = Observed Fall, Find = Later Discovery)",
       y = "Number of Meteorites") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Analysis

The bar chart above illustrates the significant disparity between meteorites that were observed falling ("Fell") versus those discovered later without witnessing the fall ("Found"). This visualization shows that the vast majority of meteorites in the NASA database were found after landing, rather than being witnessed during their descent. This pattern reflects both the randomness of meteorite landings across the globe's vast uninhabited areas and the fact that many meteorites may have landed centuries or millennia before human documentation began. The much smaller number of observed falls highlights how relatively rare it is for people to actually witness a meteorite's descent to Earth.
