    "text": "Full Context of Problem\nThis project investigates whether NCAA Division I men’s basketball teams that make the tournament tend to get to the free throw line more often than those that don’t. The data set used (cbb.csv) includes team-level performance statistics from a full season, including each team’s free throw rate (FTR). This is defined as free throw attempts per field goal attempt. To examine this, we create a new variable, made_tourney, that categorizes teams as either having qualified for the NCAA tournament or not.\nThe null hypothesis is that there is no real difference in free throw rate between teams that make the tournament. For those that don’t, any observed difference is due to random chance. The alternative hypothesis is that teams who qualify for the tournament tend to have higher free throw rates. This relationship is worth looking into because a higher FTR often reflects physicality, aggressiveness, or the ability to draw fouls. Those traits may or may not contribute to team success leading up to the tournament. We begin by visualizing the distribution of FTR across both groups, and then conduct a permutation test to assess whether the observed difference is statistically significant.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(infer)\n\n\ncbb &lt;- read_csv(\"cbb.csv\") |&gt; clean_names()\n\n# create a binary variable for whether the team made the tournament or not\ncbb &lt;- cbb |&gt; \n  mutate(made_tourney = if_else(postseason %in% c(\"2ND\", \"Champions\", \"E8\", \"F4\", \"R32\", \"R64\", \"R68\", \"S16\"), \"yes\", \"no\"))\n\n# keep only relevant columns\ncbb_filtered &lt;- cbb |&gt; \n  filter(made_tourney %in% c(\"yes\", \"no\")) |&gt; \n  select(ftr, made_tourney)\n\nVisualize Group Differences\n\n# create a boxplot to compare the distribution of Free Throw Rate (FTR)\n# between tournament and non-tournament teams\nggplot(cbb_filtered, aes(x = made_tourney, y = ftr, fill = made_tourney)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Free Throw Rate by Tournament Status\",\n    x = \"Made NCAA Tournament\",\n    y = \"Free Throw Rate (FTA/FGA)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Box Plot\nThis box plot compares Free Throw Rate (FTR) between teams that made the NCAA tournament and those that didn’t. It shows that tournament teams generally have a higher median FTR, and their overall distribution is slightly shifted upward.

I found this by calculating the means of both populations’ free throw rates and performing a permutation test of my own, where I randomly shuffled the labels of whether or not teams made the NCAA tournament 1,000 times, hypothesizing that there was no association between tournament outcome and Free Throw Rate. I then plotted the observed difference based on iteration. I found that the actual difference in means I calculated was far more extreme than any of the differences created within my simulation—effectively echoing that making it to the free throw line more often is a characteristic of teams that make the tournament over those that do not.\nData Source:\nAccessed via: https://www.kaggle.com/\nOriginal Source: Kaggle"

    "title": "Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nBack in the early 2000s, the Havasupai Tribe—a small Indigenous community living in the Grand Canyon—trusted researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) with their blood samples. They believed the researchers were going to use the samples to help study diabetes, which was a growing concern in their community. But those samples weren’t just used for diabetes studies. Without the tribe’s knowledge or consent, the blood was later used for research on schizophrenia, inbreeding, and human migration (Van Assche et al., 2013; Harmon, 2010). The tribe was shocked and devastated.\nThe situation eventually led to a lawsuit known as Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents. The core issue was that the research had crossed boundaries the tribe never agreed to, raising serious concerns about consent and respect. According to Van Assche et al. (2013), the forms may have allowed it on paper, but the tribe was never truly informed. What followed sparked broader questions about how researchers treat the people behind the data. Let’s now take a closer look at the ethical concerns raised by this case.\nDid the Havasupai truly give permission for how their blood samples were used?\nTechnically, the researchers at ASU did have a consent form. It included broad language that mentioned “behavioral/medical disorders.” That’s what they later pointed to as permission for using the data in a wider range of studies. But what happened in practice was very different. Most Havasupai members didn’t read or speak English fluently, and the research was explained to them verbally. They were told it was a diabetes study, nothing more (Van Assche et al., 2013).\nSo yes, there was a permission structure on paper. But ethically, that permission meant nothing. I believe the researchers didn’t follow through on making sure participants truly understood what they were agreeing to. As a result, the permission structure wasn’t really followed in any meaningful way.\nWas the Havasupai Tribe’s genetic data kept private, or was it shared beyond what they agreed to?\nFrom what I found in the sources, there’s no indication that the genetic data from the Havasupai Tribe was ever made publicly available in the way we usually think about open datasets. But that doesn’t mean the data wasn’t shared. In fact, some of the samples were passed on to other researchers outside of ASU, and at least one report said some were lost entirely due to a freezer malfunction (Van Assche et al., 2013). \nEven if the data wasn’t posted online or made downloadable, the fact that it was shared without consent feels like a breach of privacy and respect. I don’t think it matters whether the data was technically “public” or not. What matters is that it was out of the tribe’s control, and to me, that feels just as harmful.\nWere the blood samples used in ways that went beyond what the tribe had agreed to?\nAbsolutely. The tribe agreed to a diabetes study. That’s what they were told, and that’s what they wanted to help with. But instead, their samples were used for studies on things like schizophrenia and human migration. One study even suggested that the Havasupai people had migrated from Asia, which directly contradicted their spiritual belief that they originated in the Grand Canyon (Harmon, 2010).\nI think it’s one of the clearest examples of what can go wrong when researchers stretch the boundaries of what participants agreed to. The way the data was used left deep scars on the tribe. This all disrupted how they saw themselves, and fractured their relationship to their past.\nEven if the samples were anonymized, could the research still harm the Havasupai as a group?\nThe researchers removed names from the samples. So technically, they were anonymized. But that didn’t mean the tribe wasn’t harmed. The studies clearly focused on the Havasupai as a group. And as Van Assche et al. (2013) explain, removing names doesn’t prevent what they call “dignitary harm,” the kind of damage that happens when a group’s identity and values are disrespected.\nFor the Havasupai, the blood samples weren’t just data to them as is also considered sacred. Using them in ways the tribe didn’t approve of was more than a privacy issue.

    "text": "Back in the early 2000s, the Havasupai Tribe—a small Indigenous community living in the Grand Canyon—trusted researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) with their blood samples. They believed the researchers were going to use the samples to help study diabetes, which was a growing concern in their community. But those samples weren’t just used for diabetes studies. Without the tribe’s knowledge or consent, the blood was later used for research on schizophrenia, inbreeding, and human migration (Van Assche et al., 2013; Harmon, 2010). The tribe was shocked and devastated.\nThis situation eventually led to a lawsuit titled Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents. More than a legal battle, I see it as a turning point that raised serious ethical questions about data use, informed consent, and the responsibilities researchers have to the communities they study. Using ideas from data feminism and the Data Values and Principles manifesto, I will explore what went wrong and what I think we can learn from it."

    "text": "What is the permission structure for using the data? Was it followed?\nTechnically, the researchers at ASU did have a consent form. It included broad language that mentioned “behavioral/medical disorders.” That’s what they later pointed to as permission for using the data in a wider range of studies. But what happened in practice was very different. Most Havasupai members didn’t read or speak English fluently, and the research was explained to them verbally. They were told it was a diabetes study, nothing more (Van Assche et al., 2013).\nSo yes, there was a permission structure on paper. But ethically, that permission meant nothing. I believe the researchers didn’t follow through on making sure participants truly understood what they were agreeing to. As a result, the permission structure wasn’t really followed in any meaningful way."

    "text": "Were the data made publicly available?\nFrom what I found in the sources, there’s no indication that the genetic data from the Havasupai Tribe was ever made publicly available in the way we usually think about open datasets. But that doesn’t mean the data wasn’t shared. In fact, some of the samples were passed on to other researchers outside of ASU, and at least one report said some were lost entirely due to a freezer malfunction (Van Assche et al., 2013). \nEven if the data wasn’t posted online or made downloadable, the fact that it was shared without consent feels like a breach of privacy and respect. I don’t think it matters whether the data was technically “public” or not. What matters is that it was out of the tribe’s control, and to me, that feels just as harmful."

But instead, their samples were used for studies on things like schizophrenia and human migration. One study even suggested that the Havasupai people had migrated from Asia, which directly contradicted their spiritual belief that they originated in the Grand Canyon (Harmon, 2010).\nI think it’s one of the clearest examples of what can go wrong when researchers stretch the boundaries of what participants agreed to. The way the data was used left deep scars on the tribe. This all disrupted how they saw themselves, and fractured their relationship to their past."

    "text": "Is the data identifiable? All of it? Some of it? In what way? Are the data sufficiently anonymized or old to be free of ethical concerns? Is anonymity guaranteed?\nThe researchers removed names from the samples. So technically, they were anonymized. But that didn’t mean the tribe wasn’t harmed. The studies clearly focused on the Havasupai as a group. And as Van Assche et al. (2013) explain, removing names doesn’t prevent what they call “dignitary harm,” the kind of damage that happens when a group’s identity and values are disrespected.\nFor the Havasupai, the blood samples weren’t just data to them as is also considered sacred. Using them in ways the tribe didn’t approve of was more than a privacy issue. As I mentioned earlier, some of the samples had already been lost or handed over to outside researchers."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis project explores racial disparities in traffic stop outcomes using data from the Stanford Open Policing Project (Pierson et al., 2020). Using SQL to query a MariaDB database, we investigate differences in search rates across multiple cities and dig deeper into patterns within a single city. Our goal is to surface insights into how policing practices differ by race and geography using fully SQL-based data wrangling and R for visualization.\n\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(RMariaDB)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n# Establish connection to the traffic database\ncon_traffic &lt;- dbConnect(\n  RMariaDB::MariaDB(),\n  dbname   = \"traffic\",\n  host     = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_HOST\"),\n  user     = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_USER\"),\n  password = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_PWD\")\n)\n\n\nComparing Search Rates Across Cities and Races\n\nSELECT\n  city,\n  subject_race,\n  ROUND(100.0 * AVG(CASE WHEN search_conducted THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2) AS search_rate\nFROM (\n    SELECT 'Charlotte' AS city, subject_race, search_conducted\n      FROM nc_charlotte_2020_04_01\n      WHERE YEAR(date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT 'Raleigh' AS city, subject_race, search_conducted\n      FROM nc_raleigh_2020_04_01\n      WHERE YEAR(date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014\n    UNION ALL\n    SELECT 'Greensboro' AS city, subject_race, search_conducted\n      FROM nc_greensboro_2020_04_01\n      WHERE YEAR(date) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014\n) AS combined\nGROUP BY city, subject_race\nORDER BY city, search_rate DESC;\n\n\nggplot(race_search, aes(x = reorder(subject_race, -search_rate),\n                        y = search_rate, fill = city)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Search Rates by Race (2010–2014)\",\n    x = \"Race\",\n    y = \"Search Rate (%)\",\n    fill = \"City\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription: This is a plot comparing search rates by race for Charlotte, Raleigh, and Greensboro (all North Carolina cities). Charlotte shows that Black drivers have the highest search rate at around 6.75% compared to just over 2.25% of White drivers; Raleigh is second with almost 3.95% for Blacks and 1.95% for Whites; Greensboro, similar to Charlotte, has about 5.14% for Black people and 2.41% for White people. This alludes to a consistent frame across these three cities that no matter where individuals are stopped, historically Black males and females are searched disproportionately higher—and by a long shot—when pulled over in comparison to their White counterparts. The fact that the three cities are so consistent in their gaps makes it hard to disavow random variance or specific variances in one city’s policing efforts. However, this represents a national problem that indicates there is a systematic difference between how one race is treated against another. Hispanic and Asian drivers tend to float around the middle or lower ends of the extremes; for example, Hispanic drivers have a higher overall search percentage than White drivers but lower than Black drivers.\n\n\nStop Outcomes in Oakland, California\n\nSELECT\n  outcome,\n  COUNT(*) AS count,\n  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / total.total_count, 2) AS percent\nFROM ca_oakland_2020_04_01,\n     (SELECT COUNT(*) \n     AS total_count FROM ca_oakland_2020_04_01 WHERE outcome IS NOT NULL)\n     AS total\nWHERE outcome IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY outcome, total.total_count\nORDER BY count DESC;\n\n\nggplot(oakland_outcomes, aes(x = reorder(outcome, -count), y = percent)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Stop Outcomes in Oakland (2013-2017)\",\n    x = \"Stop Outcome\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Total Stops\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription: This is the outcome of traffic stops in Oakland, California. For the total number of traffic stops, 52% end in citation, 31% end in warning, and 17% end in arrest. The fact that over half of all traffic stops end in citation shows that the majority of traffic violations are minor in nature, yet Oakland law enforcement officials felt that these actions were egregious enough to render a formal citation. With almost one-third of the actions resulting in a warning, this could either mean that the officers give a lot of warnings based on their discretion or that the action was so minor that a citation would be an overreach; either way, this is a fair amount of leeway given. The most surprising statistic is that 17% end in arrest which means that 1 out of every 6 people gets arrested during a stop. This is a relatively high number for either having a large amount of stops based on reasonable suspicion or, conversely, having an overly aggressive policy towards law enforcement where more arrests are had than in other precincts.\nConclusion: Using SQL and R, we analyzed search rates and stop outcomes across and within cities. We used multiple SQL tables and functions (UNION ALL, ROUND, CASE WHEN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE) to handle our wrangling exclusively within the database. This approach allowed us to uncover patterns of racial disparity and enforcement trends across jurisdictions. Our comparison across cities revealed that Black drivers face disproportionately high search rates, while city-level breakdowns like in Oakland showed that most stops result in either citations or warnings, but that arrests are not uncommon. The data were sourced from the Stanford Open Policing Project (Pierson et al., 2020), and the analysis suggests that both the rate and nature of stops vary significantly depending on location and race.\nCitation\nPierson, E., Corbett-Davies, S., & Goel, S.
