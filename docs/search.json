    "text": "Full Context of Problem\nThis project investigates whether NCAA Division I men’s basketball teams that make the tournament tend to get to the free throw line more often than those that don’t. The data set used (cbb.csv) includes team-level performance statistics from a full season, including each team’s free throw rate (FTR). This is defined as free throw attempts per field goal attempt. To examine this, we create a new variable, made_tourney, that categorizes teams as either having qualified for the NCAA tournament or not.\nThe null hypothesis is that there is no real difference in free throw rate between teams that make the tournament. For those that don’t, any observed difference is due to random chance. The alternative hypothesis is that teams who qualify for the tournament tend to have higher free throw rates. This relationship is worth looking into because a higher FTR often reflects physicality, aggressiveness, or the ability to draw fouls. Those traits may or may not contribute to team success leading up to the tournament. We begin by visualizing the distribution of FTR across both groups, and then conduct a permutation test to assess whether the observed difference is statistically significant.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(infer)\n\n\ncbb &lt;- read_csv(\"cbb.csv\") |&gt; clean_names()\n\n# create a binary variable for whether the team made the tournament or not\ncbb &lt;- cbb |&gt; \n  mutate(made_tourney = if_else(postseason %in% c(\"2ND\", \"Champions\", \"E8\", \"F4\", \"R32\", \"R64\", \"R68\", \"S16\"), \"yes\", \"no\"))\n\n# keep only relevant columns\ncbb_filtered &lt;- cbb |&gt; \n  filter(made_tourney %in% c(\"yes\", \"no\")) |&gt; \n  select(ftr, made_tourney)\n\nVisualize Group Differences\n\n# create a boxplot to compare the distribution of Free Throw Rate (FTR)\n# between tournament and non-tournament teams\nggplot(cbb_filtered, aes(x = made_tourney, y = ftr, fill = made_tourney)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Free Throw Rate by Tournament Status\",\n    x = \"Made NCAA Tournament\",\n    y = \"Free Throw Rate (FTA/FGA)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Box Plot\nThis box plot compares Free Throw Rate (FTR) between teams that made the NCAA tournament and those that didn’t. It shows that tournament teams generally have a higher median FTR, and their overall distribution is slightly shifted upward.

I found this by calculating the means of both populations’ free throw rates and performing a permutation test of my own, where I randomly shuffled the labels of whether or not teams made the NCAA tournament 1,000 times, hypothesizing that there was no association between tournament outcome and Free Throw Rate. I then plotted the observed difference based on iteration. I found that the actual difference in means I calculated was far more extreme than any of the differences created within my simulation—effectively echoing that making it to the free throw line more often is a characteristic of teams that make the tournament over those that do not.\nData Source:\nAccessed via: https://www.kaggle.com/\nOriginal Source: Kaggle"

    "title": "Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nBack in the early 2000s, the Havasupai Tribe—a small Indigenous community living in the Grand Canyon—trusted researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) with their blood samples. They believed the researchers were going to use the samples to help study diabetes, which was a growing concern in their community. But those samples weren’t just used for diabetes studies. Without the tribe’s knowledge or consent, the blood was later used for research on schizophrenia, inbreeding, and human migration (Van Assche et al., 2013; Harmon, 2010). The tribe was shocked and devastated.\nThe situation eventually led to a lawsuit known as Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents. The core issue was that the research had crossed boundaries the tribe never agreed to, raising serious concerns about consent and respect. According to Van Assche et al. (2013), the forms may have allowed it on paper, but the tribe was never truly informed. What followed sparked broader questions about how researchers treat the people behind the data. Let’s now take a closer look at the ethical concerns raised by this case.\nDid the Havasupai truly give permission for how their blood samples were used?\nTechnically, the researchers at ASU did have a consent form. It included broad language that mentioned “behavioral/medical disorders.” That’s what they later pointed to as permission for using the data in a wider range of studies. But what happened in practice was very different. Most Havasupai members didn’t read or speak English fluently, and the research was explained to them verbally. They were told it was a diabetes study, nothing more (Van Assche et al., 2013).\nSo yes, there was a permission structure on paper. But ethically, that permission meant nothing. I believe the researchers didn’t follow through on making sure participants truly understood what they were agreeing to. As a result, the permission structure wasn’t really followed in any meaningful way.\nWas the Havasupai Tribe’s genetic data kept private, or was it shared beyond what they agreed to?\nFrom what I found in the sources, there’s no indication that the genetic data from the Havasupai Tribe was ever made publicly available in the way we usually think about open datasets. But that doesn’t mean the data wasn’t shared. In fact, some of the samples were passed on to other researchers outside of ASU, and at least one report said some were lost entirely due to a freezer malfunction (Van Assche et al., 2013). \nEven if the data wasn’t posted online or made downloadable, the fact that it was shared without consent feels like a breach of privacy and respect. I don’t think it matters whether the data was technically “public” or not. What matters is that it was out of the tribe’s control, and to me, that feels just as harmful.\nWere the blood samples used in ways that went beyond what the tribe had agreed to?\nAbsolutely. The tribe agreed to a diabetes study. That’s what they were told, and that’s what they wanted to help with. But instead, their samples were used for studies on things like schizophrenia and human migration. One study even suggested that the Havasupai people had migrated from Asia, which directly contradicted their spiritual belief that they originated in the Grand Canyon (Harmon, 2010).\nI think it’s one of the clearest examples of what can go wrong when researchers stretch the boundaries of what participants agreed to. The way the data was used left deep scars on the tribe. This all disrupted how they saw themselves, and fractured their relationship to their past.\nEven if the samples were anonymized, could the research still harm the Havasupai as a group?\nThe researchers removed names from the samples. So technically, they were anonymized. But that didn’t mean the tribe wasn’t harmed. The studies clearly focused on the Havasupai as a group. And as Van Assche et al. (2013) explain, removing names doesn’t prevent what they call “dignitary harm,” the kind of damage that happens when a group’s identity and values are disrespected.\nFor the Havasupai, the blood samples weren’t just data to them as is also considered sacred. Using them in ways the tribe didn’t approve of was more than a privacy issue.

    "text": "Back in the early 2000s, the Havasupai Tribe—a small Indigenous community living in the Grand Canyon—trusted researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) with their blood samples. They believed the researchers were going to use the samples to help study diabetes, which was a growing concern in their community. But those samples weren’t just used for diabetes studies. Without the tribe’s knowledge or consent, the blood was later used for research on schizophrenia, inbreeding, and human migration (Van Assche et al., 2013; Harmon, 2010). The tribe was shocked and devastated.\nThis situation eventually led to a lawsuit titled Havasupai Tribe v. Arizona Board of Regents. More than a legal battle, I see it as a turning point that raised serious ethical questions about data use, informed consent, and the responsibilities researchers have to the communities they study. Using ideas from data feminism and the Data Values and Principles manifesto, I will explore what went wrong and what I think we can learn from it."

    "text": "What is the permission structure for using the data? Was it followed?\nTechnically, the researchers at ASU did have a consent form. It included broad language that mentioned “behavioral/medical disorders.” That’s what they later pointed to as permission for using the data in a wider range of studies. But what happened in practice was very different. Most Havasupai members didn’t read or speak English fluently, and the research was explained to them verbally. They were told it was a diabetes study, nothing more (Van Assche et al., 2013).\nSo yes, there was a permission structure on paper. But ethically, that permission meant nothing. I believe the researchers didn’t follow through on making sure participants truly understood what they were agreeing to. As a result, the permission structure wasn’t really followed in any meaningful way."

    "section": "Were the data made publicly available?",
    "text": "Were the data made publicly available?\nFrom what I found in the sources, there’s no indication that the genetic data from the Havasupai Tribe was ever made publicly available in the way we usually think about open datasets. But that doesn’t mean the data wasn’t shared. In fact, some of the samples were passed on to other researchers outside of ASU, and at least one report said some were lost entirely due to a freezer malfunction (Van Assche et al., 2013). \nEven if the data wasn’t posted online or made downloadable, the fact that it was shared without consent feels like a breach of privacy and respect. I don’t think it matters whether the data was technically “public” or not. What matters is that it was out of the tribe’s control, and to me, that feels just as harmful."

    "text": "Is the data being used in unintended ways to the original study?\nAbsolutely. The tribe agreed to a diabetes study. That’s what they were told, and that’s what they wanted to help with. But instead, their samples were used for studies on things like schizophrenia and human migration. One study even suggested that the Havasupai people had migrated from Asia, which directly contradicted their spiritual belief that they originated in the Grand Canyon (Harmon, 2010).\nI think it’s one of the clearest examples of what can go wrong when researchers stretch the boundaries of what participants agreed to. The way the data was used left deep scars on the tribe. This all disrupted how they saw themselves, and fractured their relationship to their past."

    "text": "Is the data identifiable? All of it? Some of it? In what way? Are the data sufficiently anonymized or old to be free of ethical concerns? Is anonymity guaranteed?\nThe researchers removed names from the samples. So technically, they were anonymized. But that didn’t mean the tribe wasn’t harmed. The studies clearly focused on the Havasupai as a group. And as Van Assche et al. (2013) explain, removing names doesn’t prevent what they call “dignitary harm,” the kind of damage that happens when a group’s identity and values are disrespected.\nFor the Havasupai, the blood samples weren’t just data to them as is also considered sacred. Using them in ways the tribe didn’t approve of was more than a privacy issue. As I mentioned earlier, some of the samples had already been lost or handed over to outside researchers."
